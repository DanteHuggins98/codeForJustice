                <h1>Awareness - What is human trafficking?</h1>
                <p>What is human trafficking? 
                    a crime whereby traffickers exploit and profit at the expense of adults or children by compelling them to perform labor or engage in commercial sex. Human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act. Every year, millions of men, women, and children are trafficked worldwide â€“ including right here in the United States. It can happen in any community and victims can be any age, race, gender, or nationality. Traffickers might use violence, manipulation, or false promises of well-paying jobs or romantic relationships to lure victims into trafficking situations.
                Traffickers use force, fraud, or coercion to lure their victims and force them into labor or commercial sexual exploitation. They look for people who are susceptible for a variety of reasons, including psychological or emotional vulnerability, economic hardship, lack of a social safety net, natural disasters, or political instability. The trauma caused by the traffickers can be so great that many may not identify themselves as victims or ask for help, even in highly public settings. <br>

                The three types of trafficking
                Sex trafficking: 
                Forced labor: Forced labor is any work or service which people are forced to do against their will, under threat of punishment. It affects millions of men, women and children around the world. It is most often found in industries with a lot of workers and little regulation. Forced labour is the most common element of modern slavery. It is the most extreme form of people exploitation. Although many people associate forced labour and slavery with physical violence, in fact the ways used to force people to work are more insidious and ingrained in some cultures.
